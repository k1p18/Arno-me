                  At preline, our mission has always been focused on bringing
                  openness and transparency to the design process. We've always
                  believed that by providing a space where designers can share
                  ongoing work not only empowers them to make better products,
                  it also helps them grow.

                As we've grown, we've seen how Preline has helped companies such
                as Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and Intercom bring
                their designers closer together to create amazing things. We've
                also learned that when the culture of sharing is brought in
                earlier, the better teams adapt and communicate with one
                another.

                  We know the power of sharing is real, and we want to create an
                  opportunity for everyone to try Preline and explore how
                  transformative open communication can be. Now you can have a
                  team of one or two designers and unlimited spectators (think
                  PMs, management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the
                  design process earlier.

                Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can
                watch the design process unfold, both for themselves and for the
                people they work with â€“ no matter if it's a fellow designer,
                product manager, developer or client. Preline allows you to
                invite more people into the process, creating a central place
                for conversation around design. As those teams grow,
                transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in how they
                communicate and work together.
